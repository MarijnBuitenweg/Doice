# Doice: A dicerolling program that does not need to exist

## Plans for next major version

- Retire DoiceOS, it's a dumb name. It will be succeeded by Doice.
- Retire the old 'window management' style of doing UI. It will be succeeded by a more tailored experience.

## Ideas that may or may not be implemented

- GPT integration, for diceroll and character sheet management.
- 5etools integration, maybe via something like memexec and include_dir.

## Changelogs

### Version 2.3.4

- Cleaner CLI
- Improved initiative tracker
- Fixed diceroll history (Source of diceroll is being shown again)
- Reduced size executables (no one was using the dnd data anyways)
